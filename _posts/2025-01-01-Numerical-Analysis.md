## Personal Reflection
### Reflection on Data Analysis Skills and Statistical Knowledge
Over the course of this module, I have gained a solid foundation in both descriptive and inferential statistics, with a particular emphasis on practical application using R. Beginning with an understanding of data types and measurement scales (Unit 1), I developed confidence in organising, summarising, and interpreting data, which are essential for real-world statistical tasks.
As the units progressed, my familiarity with probability theory, sampling, and the rules of probability distributions deepened my appreciation for how uncertainty is managed in data-driven decision-making. I am now confident in using parametric (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) and non-parametric (e.g., Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis) statistical methods appropriately, based on assumptions about data distribution.
Although challenging at first, I gradually became more confident navigating R’s statistical functions, especially after practical tasks like hypothesis testing and regression analysis. Overall, I now feel comfortable performing comprehensive data analysis tasks, from loading data to drawing conclusions supported by statistical evidence.

 
### Reflection on Confidence in Using R for Statistical Analysis
Initially, I found R's syntax a little while to adjust as it had been years since I had used R, especially when performing more complex tasks such as matrix manipulation or working with plots. However, repeated exposure to data management, data structures, and visualization functions helped overcome this barrier.
Units 2 and 3 helped me understand how to work with vectors, data frames, and manage missing data — foundational skills for any statistical project. As I practiced with different datasets and statistical procedures, I became much more confident using R to run analyses efficiently.
That said, I occasionally faced challenges:
•	Interpreting error messages
•	Understanding the structure of nested R functions
•	Customising plots (especially with ggplot2)
But these obstacles significantly lessened with time, practice, and using online resources.
 
### Reflection on Interpreting Statistical Findings (p-values & Confidence Intervals)
While I have done work around statistical significance in an A/B test, it was a major highlight of the course that I formally learnt how to interpret statistical test results, especially using p-values and confidence intervals (Unit 6). These tools helped me move beyond basic descriptive statistics to make inferences about populations.
I now understand that:
•	A p-value < 0.05 generally indicates statistical significance, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis.
•	A 95% confidence interval provides a range within which we are reasonably sure the true value lies.
This skill was particularly important in evaluating gender-based or region-based differences in alcohol consumption, where statistical significance determined the reliability of observed differences.
 
### Reflection on Producing Summary Tables, Contingency Tables & Plots in R
Creating summary tables, contingency tables, and visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms, boxplots) in R was another valuable skill I acquired, especially during Units 5 and 9. These tools helped me translate raw data into intuitive insights.
I particularly enjoyed:
•	Using summary(), table(), and prop.table() to describe and compare variables
•	Creating cross-tabulations for categorical analysis (e.g., gender vs. alcohol use)
•	Visualising distributions and relationships using plot(), hist(), and ggplot2
Being able to present statistical results clearly and visually enhanced both my analysis and communication skills.
 
### Conclusion
Overall, this module has significantly enhanced my statistical literacy and practical skills in R. I now feel capable of:
•	Managing and analysing diverse datasets
•	Selecting appropriate statistical methods
•	Interpreting results using statistical reasoning
•	Communicating findings through visual and tabular outputs
I look forward to applying these skills in both academic and professional settings, and I am motivated to further refine my knowledge in predictive analytics and advanced statistical modelling.
